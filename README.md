# account-frontend
AVWX account portal frontend

Replacement for existing [account management site](https://account.avwx.rest)

Supported by the new [account backend](https://github.com/avwx-rest/account-backend)

## Requirements

Integrates with the account API - [documentation](https://avwx-account-dev.azurewebsites.net/docs)

Website Features:
- User registration
- Password reset
- Login and auth via JWT
- Update account profile information
- Built-in and email notification view and preferences
- Change pricing plan and add-ons
- Add, view, update, and remove API tokens
- View API usage graphs
- Stripe Checkout integration

Must include documentation for self-maintenance.

## Desired

- Built with Vue.js but React or Angular would suffice
- A CSS framework using or similar to Bootstrap

It shouldn't be a copy of the existing account portal. That was my best attempt with no frontend design chops.
